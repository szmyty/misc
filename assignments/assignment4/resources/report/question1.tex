    \jupynotex[3-5]{assignment4.ipynb}

    \subsection{Load the data into a Pandas dataframe. Extract two dataframes with the above 4 features: df\_0 for surviving patients (DEATH\_EVENT = 0) and df\_1 for deceased patients (DEATH\_EVENT = 1)} \label{subsec:question1.1}

    \answer{\jupynotex[6]{assignment4.ipynb}}

    \subsection{For each dataset, construct the visual representations of the corresponding correlation matrices \var{$M_0$} (from df\_0) and \var{$M_1$} (from df\_1) and save the plots into two separate files} \label{subsec:question1.2}

    \answer{\jupynotex[7-8]{assignment4.ipynb}}

    \subsection{Examine your correlation matrix plots visually and answer the following} \label{subsec:question1.3}
