    \question{
        Summarize your results for Naive Bayesian,
        decision tree and random forest in a table below and discuss your findings.
    }

    \answer{\jupynotex[18-20]{main.ipynb}}

    After arranging the statistics of each classifier in the table, it stands out that the random forest classifier has a very high recall value compared to the others.
    All the classifiers have relatively high accuracies (all above 70\%), but random forest performed the best.
    The decision tree's accuracy was pretty high as well, but knowing that the decision tree is more unstable than the random forest, that accuracy value would fluctuate with different data.
